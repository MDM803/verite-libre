As global supply chains continue to reshape under the weight of geopolitical tensions and shifting alliances, nations face unprecedented choices in their trade policies. The era of unfettered globalization appears to be giving way to a more fragmented, regionalized approach to economic integration.

## The Rise of Regionalism

In recent years, we have witnessed a significant pivot towards regional trade agreements. The RCEP in Asia, the African Continental Free Trade Area, and the strengthening of existing blocs like the EU all point to a new paradigm where proximity and shared values increasingly trump pure economic efficiency.

This shift has profound implications for smaller, trade-dependent economies. For Sri Lanka, strategically positioned in the Indian Ocean, the question is not simply which bloc to align with, but how to leverage its unique position to maximize benefits from multiple trading relationships.

## Policy Implications

The key challenge for policymakers is to navigate these turbulent waters without sacrificing the gains from trade. This requires a nuanced approach that balances openness with strategic protections, encourages innovation while safeguarding traditional industries, and builds resilience into the economic fabric of the nation.

As we look ahead, the countries that will thrive are those that invest in human capital, embrace technological transformation, and maintain the institutional flexibility to pivot as circumstances require. The global trade tides are indeed in transition—and the time to prepare is now.
